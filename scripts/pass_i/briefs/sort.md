# Pass I, sort leg: ${title} deep reference

A deep reference (`frozen-deep.md`) was audited twice, independently:
- **Blind audit**: findings in `blind-findings.md`. It didn't edit anything.
- **Fix-in-place audit**: log in `fixer-audit-log.md`, result in `post-audit-deep.md` (sha256 in `post-audit-deep.sha256`).

The source is `tape.md`, with the original (`source.*`, if present) for provenance and for any table, figure or chart. The audit standard is `pass-i-spec.md`, and `fixtures/` holds three calibration exemplars.

Read the fixtures and `pass-i-spec.md`, then both audits, then `post-audit-deep.md` in full. Check each finding against the tape yourself; neither audit is authoritative. Sort every finding from both audits into:
- **Confirmed and fixed:** a real defect, correctly fixed in the post-audit deep.
- **Confirmed, fix wrong or incomplete.**
- **Missed by the fix-in-place audit:** a blind-audit finding not fixed in the post-audit deep and still a defect.
- **Over-flagged:** doesn't hold against the source. Say whose.
- **Disputed:** a genuine judgement call; give both readings.

Also check whether any fix-in-place edit introduced a new defect.

## Output

1. What you read.
2. The sorted ledger, with the post-audit-deep line and tape line or page for each.
3. **Remaining edits:** an exact, numbered list of changes still needed in `post-audit-deep.md`. Give the current text and the replacement, or "strip". Only include edits you've verified against the source.
4. Counts: confirmed, missed, over-flagged (by each auditor), disputed.
5. A gate verdict once the remaining edits are applied: pass, or fail with reasons.

Edit no file other than the report.
